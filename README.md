# Sinatra Bucketlist Application Project

## Description:  

 This project is a simple application that involves bucket listing. We all might have a bucket list because over time we all aspired to do particular things that we most times dont get to. For example, I want to go to Egypt but time has proven that the busy grind can push desires like that to the side. Really these things are adventures most would take but havent, so it is put into a bucket list of things I will do.

 The application is exactly that, a bucket list. The user can sign up and once signed up the user can add anything goal to their own personal list. The user has to sign up with an chosen user name, email, and password. They can add a goal and edit or delet it.
